Cruno

Cruno is a modular monolith task scheduling and job orchestration system built with .NET. It is designed to distribute, execute, retry, and monitor background jobs across distributed workers. Cruno is ideal for complex systems requiring reliable and traceable background task execution in a distributed environment.

ðŸš€ Getting Started

Prerequisites:

.NET 8 SDK

RabbitMQ

Redis

Running the System:

# Restore and build
> dotnet restore
> dotnet build

# Run API (Exposes endpoints)
> dotnet run --project src/Cruno.API

# Run Worker (Consumes and executes jobs)
> dotnet run --project src/Cruno.WorkerService

ðŸ“œ Message Contract: JobExecutionMessage

{
  "jobId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "payload": "{...}",
  "retryCount": 0,
  "retryStrategy": "None"
}
